<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cris and I am a self-taught programmer.During my lifetime I have studied and worked in various fields such as sales,administration,transportation and retail.I studied programming in high school but for some reason I chose a different path in life and I found myself at 30 years old desiring to return to the field.Even though I didn't work in this field until now, I still built a few websites in Wordpress from my passion for blogging.From there I got this desire to build a website from scratch.</p>
